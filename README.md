Set of R scripts to process and analyze Distortion Interaction - Activation Strain Model results, in the field of Computational Chemistry.

The first 3 script files allow for processing data coming for autoDIAS python tool[^1]. In the first two scripts, raw data is imported, processed and cleaned. Then, processed data can be used to generate distortion-interaction diagrams (script 03). The fourth script allows statistical analysis of Energy Decomposition Analysis results. 

This set of scripts was written for the research in the context of a PhD Thesis. To the moment, the data and thesis manuscript are not available. 

This tool was also used to process and analyse the results published in "Diels–Alder Reactivity of Allenylboronic Acid Pinacol Ester and Related Dienophiles: Mechanistic Studies and Distortion/Interaction-Activation Strain Model Analysis"[^2].
